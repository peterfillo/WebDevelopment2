		<h2>Who we are</h2>
		<hr>
		
		<p>Fit Nest is a fitness resource website that was developed by 3 people (Samuel Angus, Joshua Chiu, Sealtiel Villegas) with the intention to improve the health of people who have stay-at-home lifestyles. With eyes constantly glued to computer and phone screens, it's easy for many to neglect their physical and mental health.</p>
    
		<p>To prevent exhaustion and loss of motivation from browsing through many different sites, Fit Nest provides condensed and organized information regarding different aspects of health.</p>
